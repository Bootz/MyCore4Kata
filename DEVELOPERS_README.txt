~note from Bootz (Aptiva):
If you are working on this project for the rebase...
and find a situation (and we all know they comeup) where the code,
your about to commit is hacky...
add a damn comment in your the changed source to let the others know,
and we can eventually get it changed and properly updated...
less work arounds, clean coding proceedures, shouldnt be all that hard
to stick to.
